## 📖 Overview

Setting up a home lab from scratch can be repetitive and tedious. This repository provides **production-ready bash scripts** designed to rapidly configure Proxmox nodes and LXC containers with industry best practices, saving you time and ensuring a secure baseline.

### 🌐 Network access (local-first)

**By default, every service stays on your LAN** — each script assigns a static IP and you open it from your home network (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8080`). Nothing is published to the internet automatically.

| Access method | Scripts | Use when |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **LAN only** (default) | All setup scripts | Normal home use — NAS, media, DNS, Vaultwarden, etc. |
| **Domain + HTTPS** (optional) | `setup_dashboard.sh` (AutoExposer) | You own a domain and want `*.yourdomain.com` via NPM + Cloudflare |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** (optional) | `setup_n8n.sh` | You need **n8n** (and Evolution API) reachable from outside; leave the token blank to keep it local too |

> **Typical setup:** keep Core, NAS, Media, DNS, and Sync on the LAN; expose only **n8n** through a Cloudflare Tunnel if you need remote automation.

**LXC shell access:** scripts do not ask for a container root password. Manage containers from the Proxmox host with `pct enter <CTID>` (requires host `root` / `sudo`).

---

## 🎛️ Interactive Unified Menu (`menu.sh`)

The easiest and recommended way to use this repository is via the new interactive menu. It automatically discovers all available setup scripts and lets you run them with a single keystroke, without having to copy-paste multiple commands.

**🚀 Run Command:**
*(Run from your Proxmox Host as a regular sudo user)*
```bash
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3lmagary/homeserver/main/menu.sh | sudo bash
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### 1️⃣ Proxmox Base Setup (`setup.sh`)

A foundational script for fresh Proxmox VE nodes. It handles repository management, creates a secure non-root user, sets up a beautiful terminal experience, and configures auto-login — all in one command.

> **Note:** This script is fully **idempotent** — you can safely re-run it multiple times without breaking anything.

<details>
<summary><b>✨ View Features</b></summary>

- 🛠 **Smart Repo Fixes:** Automatically disables **all** paid Enterprise repos (PVE & Ceph, both `.list` and `.sources` formats) and adds the free No-Subscription repo. Dynamically detects the Debian codename (`bookworm`, `trixie`, etc.).
- 🔄 **Safe Updates:** Full system update & upgrade after repo cleanup.
- 📦 **Essential Tools:** Installs `curl`, `git`, `htop`, `sudo`, `zsh`, `nano`, `iotop`, `iftop`, and network tools.
- 👤 **Smart User Management:**
  - Auto-detects existing non-root users (skips system accounts).
  - Interactive username input with validation and retry loop.
  - Supports non-standard usernames via `--allow-bad-names` confirmation.
- 🎨 **Terminal Aesthetics:** Installs **Oh My Zsh** with the `robbyrussell` theme and two essential plugins:
  - `zsh-autosuggestions` — Smart command auto-completion from history.
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting` — Real-time syntax coloring.
- 🔐 **Auto-Login:**
  - Configures `tty1` for automatic physical console login.
  - Automatically switches from `root` to your user when opening the **Proxmox Web GUI Shell**.
</details>

**🚀 Run Command:**
*(Run as root on a fresh Proxmox install)*
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3lmagary/homeserver/main/setup.sh)
```

### 2️⃣ Expandable NAS Setup (`nas_setup.sh`)

The ultimate, intelligent script to mount external hard drives (USB/SATA) and share them over the network (SMB/Samba) using a dynamically created, unprivileged LXC container.

> **Note:** Since the first script logs you in as a normal user, **you must use `sudo`** to run this script so it can interact with Proxmox storage and LXC commands.

<details>
<summary><b>✨ View Features</b></summary>

- 🛡️ **Foolproof Drive Detection:** Scans all connected drives and **completely hides your Proxmox OS disk** (and all its partitions) from the selection menu — making it impossible to accidentally format your system drive.
- 🧠 **Smart Drive Presentation:** If a drive is already partitioned (e.g. has `sdb1`), only the partition is shown — not the raw parent disk — to avoid confusion.
- 🔄 **Smart Formatting Logic:**
  - If the drive is already `ext4`, it skips formatting and proceeds.
  - If the drive is `NTFS` or `exFAT`, it warns you and gives you the choice to format to `ext4` for best server performance, or keep the existing format (automatically installing `ntfs-3g` / `exfat-fuse`).
- 🏷️ **Custom Drive Naming:** Asks you to name the drive (e.g. `Movies`, `Backup`) and creates a clean folder in `/mnt/<name>` — no ugly UUID paths.
- 📌 **Persistent Mounting:** Extracts the drive's UUID and adds it to `/etc/fstab` so it survives reboots. Re-running on the same drive is safe and skips re-mounting.
- 🐳 **Expandable LXC Architecture:**
  - **First Run:** Creates a lightweight, unprivileged Debian 12 LXC container (`Samba-NAS`), installs Samba, and bind-mounts your drive inside it.
  - **Subsequent Runs:** If you add a 2nd or 3rd hard drive, the script detects the existing `Samba-NAS` container and injects the new drive into it automatically — no new containers created!
- 🌐 **Network Configuration:** Supports both DHCP and Static IP. For Static IP, the script auto-detects your gateway and suggests a valid IP example so you can't type something wrong.
- 🔐 **Security Choice:** Prompts you to secure your share with a password (using your system username automatically) or create a public guest share.
- 🖥️ **Multi-Platform Access Instructions:** The final output shows how to connect from **Windows**, **Mac**, and **Linux**.
- 🛡️ **Proper UID Mapping:** Automatically handles UID/GID mapping (`101000:101000`) for `ext4` drives inside unprivileged containers for correct write permissions.
</details>

**🚀 Run Command:**
*(Run from your Proxmox Host as a regular sudo user)*
```bash
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3lmagary/homeserver/main/nas_setup.sh | sudo bash
```
